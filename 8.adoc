You should know the mantra by now: "`Vim does a lot by itself`". But Vim doesn't do _everything_ and, sometimes, we would like it to do what it does in a slightly different way.

== Vimscript

=== Functions

=== Commands

=== Variables

=== Etc.

== Good practices

== Plugins

A "`Plugin`" is one or more scripts written by other Vimmers to extend Vim in one way or another. Some plugins may add support for a language not supported by Vim natively. Some plugins may provide a more useable abstraction over a built-in feature. Some plugins may give you a nice colorscheme. Some plugins may provide no benefit whatsoever. Some plugins... Well there are _thousands_ of them.

=== When to look for plugins

For the self-respecting Patient Vimmer, installing a third-party plugin should be the last resort. Not because plugins are antiethical or whatever but because there's more often than not a built-in way to do what you want and/or a built-in way to customize Vim to do what you want the way you want.

Let's say you are starting with Vim. You have read a few threads on http://reddit.com/r/vim[r/vim] or the poorly named https://news.ycombinator.com/newsi[Hacker News], a couple of highly voted answers on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vim?sort=votes&pageSize=30[Stack Overflow] and most importantly two dozens of blog posts that _all_ advised you to install the same plugin for a nice "file explorer pane". Comforted by that consensus around [NERDTree] you install it only to find out in its documentation that there's already a built-in file explorer that does everything that third-party plugin does _and more_.
