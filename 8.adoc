You should know the mantra by now: "`Vim does a lot by itself`". But Vim doesn't do _everything_ and, sometimes, we would like it to do what it does in a slightly different way.

== Vimscript

=== Functions

=== Commands

=== Variables

=== Etc.

== Good practices

== Plugins

A "`Plugin`" is one or more scripts written by other Vimmers to extend Vim in one way or another. Some plugins may add support for a language not supported by Vim natively. Some plugins may provide a more useable abstraction over a built-in feature. Some plugins may give you a nice colorscheme. Some plugins may provide no benefit whatsoever. Some plugins... Well there are _thousands_ of them.

=== When to look for plugins

For the self-respecting Patient Vimmer, installing a third-party plugin should be the last resort. Not because plugins are antiethical or whatever but because there's more often than not a built-in way to do what you want and/or a built-in way to customize Vim to do what you want.

In my opinion, Vimmers should look
