== Introduction

It should be clear by now that Vim is a very powerful text editor but don't be fooled, it doesn't do _everything_. Sure we get a lot of small low-level elements to play with but, sometimes, using a specialized tool would be more suited to the job. After all, shares its environment with many commandline tools so... why not putting them to good use?

With Vim, we can run external commands in -- broadly speaking -- two ways: as filters and, well, as external commands.

=== Filters

Tranforming existing text in place with another program is called _filtering_: we start with some text and replace it with the output of an external `"filter`".
